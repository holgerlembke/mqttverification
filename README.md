# mqttverification

Implements some methods to check topics for subscrition in mqtt.

## Source

It follows the source code from mosquitto published at
https://github.com/iosphere/mosquitto/blob/master/lib/util_mosq.c
and implements it as a class in C#.

Additional it implements the "Best practice rules" from HiveMQ's blog at 
// https://www.hivemq.com/blog/mqtt-essentials-part-5-mqtt-topics-best-practices/

## License, Usage, Blah blah

This is open source without restriction. It uses an almost unchanged part from mosquitto sources, so I can't claim anything anyway.

Enjoy!
